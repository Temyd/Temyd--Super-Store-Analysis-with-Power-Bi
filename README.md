# Data Sourcing
Data was provided for us and can be gotten from https://aka.ms/30DLDATGitHubRepo

# Data Cleaning 
Two set of data was provided, a Denormalised(dirty) and Normalised(clean) dataset. I used the denormalised data set to work on this project. I opened it in excel file and i broke the information down into permanent and continous data. After which i removed unecessary columns, made sure my data type was correct.

I then got a clean data (normalised) dataset

Then i saved and i uploaded my data into power bi, where i also carried out necessary transformation by removing blank rows via Power Qwery Editor.

I created a slicer containing; Months, Years, Region, and customers segment which can be applied to the visuals on the board.

Based on profit, Newyork had the highest and Philadelphia had the lowest ![TOP AND BOTTOM PROFIT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105246702/176572680-e1fe055d-db07-46d9-8305-72c5244aec12.png)


# Recommendation üìå
More resources should be put into the stores at New York cos of its high profit margin compared to other cities

The stores at Philadelphia and the remaining bottom 4 should be closed down and the resources should be distributed to other striving stores, alos the reason for the low profit should be investigated
